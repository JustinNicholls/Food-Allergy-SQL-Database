# Food-Allergy-SQL-Database
Food Allergy SQL Database. Contains tables of food allergies, the respective food products that have it, and ideally, real people who should have food allergies. Ideally, the database is a demo for a food allergy database so that people can easily search for foods products that have allergies that might affect them.
Contains the sql files needed to create tables, create the necessary views, and other things. Also has a php file in Assignment4/src, allowing users to run it on a LAMP stack. This project was created by Alex and Justin for SE3309A at the University of Western Ontario.
